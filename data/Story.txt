Sanya and Petya had been thick as thieves since they first collided—quite literally—in Professor Karandashev's AI Magic 101 class seven years ago. Their initial meeting involved a spilled coffee, scattered notes, and a shared laugh that echoed through the university halls. From that moment, they were inseparable, bonding over late-night coding sessions, questionable cafeteria food, and a mutual inability to understand Karandashev's fascination with teaching AI concepts using sock puppets.

After graduation, both found themselves working at the same monotonous bank, crunching numbers by day and dreaming of innovation by night. Their real excitement began after hours, huddled over laptops in dimly lit cafes, chain-smoking cigarettes and debating the merits of various algorithms over pints of beer. "Remember when Karandashev tried to explain machine learning with interpretive dance?" Sanya chuckled, taking a drag.

Petya nearly spat out his drink. "How could I forget? I thought he was summoning rain!"

One particularly hazy evening, inspiration struck. "Let's build something," Sanya suggested. "Something big. A Random Algorithm Generator—RAG. It'll be like Karandashev's magic, but real."

Petya's eyes lit up. "I'm in! But only if we can program it to make us coffee."

As weeks turned into months, their project became an obsession. They spent countless nights side by side, keyboards clicking in harmony. The lines between work and friendship blurred, each finding comfort in the other's presence. "You know," Petya mused one night, "I look forward to this all day."

"Debugging code until our eyes bleed?" Sanya teased.

"No," Petya smiled softly, "just... this."

They laughed it off, attributing the warmth to the beer. Yet, unspoken feelings lingered like the smoke swirling between them. They didn't realize that the true magic Karandashev hinted at wasn't in AI, but in the evolving connection they shared.

Finally, after countless trials, RAG was born. "We did it!" Sanya exclaimed, pulling Petya into a spontaneous hug. The embrace lasted a moment longer than expected, both acutely aware yet blissfully ignorant of the electricity in the air.

As they stood on their familiar rooftop, watching the sunrise signal a new day, Sanya turned to Petya. "What's next for us?"

Petya glanced back, a myriad of unspoken words in his eyes. "Anything," he replied. "As long as it's together."

They clinked their beer bottles in silent agreement, both still unaware that perhaps the greatest algorithm they'd discovered was the one quietly coding their hearts.
